## NFive Package Manager

NFive Package Manager, or more commonly known as "nfpm" is used to install plugins directly into NFive.
You can use ``nfpm search`` or [visit the plugin hub](https://hub.nfive.io/) to find plugins you may be interested in!

**Example**

```bash
nfpm install <plugin>
nfpm install <plugin>@<version>
```
