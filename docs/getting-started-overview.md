NFive is a managed .NET platform for [FiveM](https://fivem.net/) designed to help administrate servers and easily develop modular plugins.

## Concepts

NFive was developed to simplify complex server management and provide users with a modern development experience.

As users demand more and more detailed servers and mod systems become larger there is a need for easier and more unified management.

## Functionality

NFive provides no in-game functionality on its own and is purely a management system and plugin development platform. This allows NFive to remain agnostic and usable with any type of mod or game mode, with functionality added via [NFive plugins](https://hub.nfive.io/).
